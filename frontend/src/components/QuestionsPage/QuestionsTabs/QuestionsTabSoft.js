      45 behavioral questions to use during non-technical interview with developers
    </h1>

    <p>
      The way we formulate questions is crucial. If you ask the question in an ambiguous way, don’t

      <li>
        Think about an instance in which you came up with a project idea which was implemented

      <li>
        Describe a time when you made a suggestion to improve something on the project that you were
        working on.
      </li>
      <li>
